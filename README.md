# Eco-circle

Eco-circle aims to mimic our planet's natural cycles to create a more sustainable production loop. It uses AI algorithms to promote eco-friendly habits in the daily routine of the general public using personalized recommendations. Built on the 3 'R's (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle), it analyzes user data to understand their constraints and preferences for recommending eco-friendly alternate options for products, transport, etc. Features include alerts against buying similar products that are owned [reduce], showing video recommendations to use products for a longer duration [reuse], and insights into proper disposal at the consumer end [recycle].
